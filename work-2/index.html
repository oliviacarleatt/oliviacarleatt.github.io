    <h2>Work In Progress 2</h2>
    <p>Since Work in Progress 1, my website has gone through a bit of a facelift. I successfully added a profile image, wrapped the text around the image, and improved my navigation menu. This is what I envisioned the front page of my website looking like. The photo adds a bit more personality, and more interest. Making it circular also helps the fluidity and keeps the whimsical aspect of my original website aesthetic. I still believe it is relatively minimal, more so in the sense of clean lines and the white background. Spacing out the menu helped declutter the top of the page, and is easier to navigate.</p>

<p>For Work in Progress 2, I focused most on revising my soundscape and making sure the class assignments were at least displaying properly. I’m not entirely sure how I want to improve the appearance of class assignments. The Photoshop edits look a bit awkward on the page, so I want to work on the layout of the ad and movie poster tabs. Additionally, the audio players don’t seem to flow with my overall style and theme of my website. I want a cleaner looking audio bar and to figure out how to display it to be the most aesthetically pleasing.  It looks a bit heavy and I want a lighter and minimal feel to the audio section because the sound is quite heavy, so at least the appearance of the bar will reflect my website design aesthetic.</p> 

<p>As far as class assignments go, I decided to revisit my soundscape and improve the overall organization and feel of the sound clips. My group chose the theme of “inside a beer bottle.” For my first submission, it was a bit messy, choppy, and rough, and my overall plan didn’t get executed properly. This time, I started over, but I used the same sound clips as the first time. I worked on the organization of the clips to tell a story. I outlined the order of the sounds to mimic someone drinking a beer and what it would be like to be trapped inside of the bottle, also reflecting the drunken state of the person drinking the beer. The audio piece begins with friends celebrating over a winning sports game. The clinking and opening of the glass leads to gulping and an ambient floating sound that’s actually supposed to be under the water in a pool. I pretended there was a tiny shrunken human submerged in the beer holding their breath. As the soundscape goes on, the drinker goes to the bathroom and as they come out to get another drink the drunken state catches up with them. The background voices slow down and the gulping gets a lower pitch. The person in the bottle slows down with the drinker and the scene is supposed to sound like slow motion. It ends with shattering glass. This could be interpreted as the beginning of a fight or simply the drunken person dropping the bottle. I think this piece was much cleaner, concise, and effective. For the first audio submission, the narrative wasn’t as clear and was quite unpleasant to listen to. This time around I focused less on playing with echoes and strange sound effects and focused more on combining the clips to portray a narrative, and manipulating the sound slightly to mimic slow motion.</p>

<p>In regard to other class assignments, I wish I could have also finished the Photoshop advertisement. This was my favorite creative project, and I left it unfinished. I had to do a lot of work from home and I don’t have access to the program on my own laptop so I had to do Audacity. I like to try and comment on society whenever I can in classwork, for any class. This assignment I focused on the control and restriction that the beauty industry, and more importantly capitalism, have on women. The female is essentially being reduced to a skeletal form for the sake of beauty, masking the capitalistic motives. I also would have cleaned up the movie poster. Someone else in my group had done most of the actual Photoshopping. Some elements are a bit rougher and messier than I would have liked so I would have cleaned up some of the text and worked on shadows for the figures in the drain. The story board is not exactly finished. I struggled with this the most. It didn’t come easy to me and I’m still unsure what else I could add. Also, since I haven’t gotten to practice with Photoshop much, figuring out how to create the story board with the program, combined with the unsureness about my actual topic was overwhelming, so I decided to draw it. Also, it was easier for me to type up my ideas before trying to draw the storyboard out. I had to reread the article and take notes to be able to even think about starting the storyboard.</p> 

<p>Overall, since the first WIP submission I have greatly improved my HTML/CSS for my website and worked on creating a sound text more effectively. I have a better understanding of how CSS/HTML work, and it definitely feels less intimidating. While I am by no means an expert or even moderately skilled at coding, I definitely am proud of how far the appearance of my website has come. I struggled with Photoshop quite a bit and that definitely impacted the quality of some of my classwork assignments. Going forward, I hope to revise the appearance of the Photoshop images on my website. I want to work more on formatting the layout of each page. The front page matches my vision, but the classwork assignments disturb the flow and aesthetic of my website. In the final weeks, I need to really manage my time better to makes sure everything looks clean and has an easy flow. I want to get control back with my minimal and whimsical aesthetic.</p>
