    <h2>Story Board</h2>
    <p><ul>
  <li>Everyday life—bathroom example: reflecting on the simplicity of a symbol and how at first glance it seems ordinary (time-lapse of people going in out of bathrooms with fast pace—light hearted music) </li>
  <li>But what if you went somewhere else? –map or scene of bathroom images elsewhere</li>
  <li>What is natural? –binaries are not!!! Flash examples of common binary examples (gay/straight, male/female, black/white, rich/poor, in different cultures etc.)</li>
    <li>Voice Over: Why does this matter? –authors must consider that their phantasms in their personal or reginal or national context –but it’s also impactful to our meanings of life and how we interpret identity.</li>
    <li>Heavily influence our culture, especially dominant, and decide who is the US and who is the THEM</li>
    <li>Relatability or power</li>
    <li>What we see in the media and texts in our everyday life, we are seeing carefully thought out images that constitute an unquestionable or common-sense based norm</li>
    <li>This can have serious concerns when we analyze culture—baby doll example (picture of dolls) –archival footage of the studies sped up</li>
    <li>A voiceover about the study</li>
    <li>Show symbols of participants in a study explaining symbols—then ask them why they know to get them thinking—they will say it’s just how it is, BUT WHY?</li>
    <li>Relevancy to computers: Awareness of the power of phantasms can help to promote empowering and inclusive phantasms to detect and critique phantasms that are harmful to society, even if not at first glance</li>
    <li>Relate back to first bathroom example: Find a current example of a bathroom sign that is gender neutral. Interview a non-binary individual to explain the importance of cultural literacy of phantasms and how signs and understandings of prominent cultural binaries can influence inclusivity. </li>
    <li>Interview with the author</li>
    <li>conduct studies</li>
    <li>Bring everything full circle—show example of how questioning phantasms we take for granted can lead to inclusivity—changing society and creating new norms that show range in “normalcy”</li>
