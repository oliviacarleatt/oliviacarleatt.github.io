            <table>
            <tr><th>Start time/date</th><th>End time/date</th><th>Description of focus</th><th>Notes on process</th>
            <tr><td>6pm/Feb.18</td><td>6:45pm/Feb.18</td><td>Researching the best microphones for podcasting.</td><td>I wanted to check out a microphone but I’ve been busy with midterms so this week I focused on research and preparation. I researched the best microphone and found that I could rent it from the library. First, I decided I need a dynamic microphone because they're cheaper and don't pick up as much background noise as a condenser microphone; however, at Pitt the "Podcast Kit" you can rent out only has a condeser microphone. I'm going to go in the beginning of next week to inquire about borrowing a microphone.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>12pm/Feb.19</td><td>2:45pm/Feb.19</td><td>Sampling podcasts that I listen to for inspiration.</td><td>Since I didn’t have much time to practice using audacity I thought I’d focus on the concepts I wanted to incorporate in my own podcast. A chatty or scripted episode? Single speaker or multiple speakers? Serious tone or sarcastic/witty tone? I listened to some of my favorite podcasts, My Favorite Murder, Lore, Mortified, and Who Weekly. I definitely want a witty tone, and since I’m going to be a single speaker I think a script might help me out, but maybe more in the form of talking points so it doesn’t sound robotic and stiff.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>9pm/Feb.19 & 11am/Feb.23</td><td>9:30pm/Feb.19 & 12pm/Feb.23</td><td>Discussing podcast ideas with friends.</td><td>Most of my friends listen to podcasts. I had several conversations with many of my friends to hear what they liked about certain podcasts, and what they thought I should talk about. I know I want to incorporate a feminist aspect because that’s something I’m interested in. My friends like popular culture podcasts overall so I think I’m going to go in that direction. Maybe analyzing a film or show through a feminist perspective. They also told me that they won't listen to poorly recorded podcasts, or podcasts where the tone seemed forced.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>6pm/Feb.21</td><td>6:45pm/Feb.21</td><td>Getting ideas and concepts on paper for possible topics for my podcast.</td><td>I started jotting down concepts for possible scripts. A lot of my ideas have to do with representations of sexuality, gender, and race in popular culture. I also love documentaries so the concept of a podcast talking about and evaluating documentaries is top on my list, and I’m going to work on developing that idea more.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>6pm/Feb.22</td><td>9pm/Feb.22</td><td>Researching possible documentary choices by watching and sampling.</td><td>I put together a list of documentaries I’ve seen and would like to evaluate, and I also went on Kanopy to look at documentaries I might like to watch to evaluate. I watched Anita, Southern Belle, The Uncomfortable Truth, and White Like Me. All examine a social issue such as race, gender, and sexual harassment.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>11am/Feb.23</td><td>1pm/Feb.23</td><td>Watching tutorials to refresh my Audacity knowledge, and learn basics of podcasting with the program. Additionally, I practiced these skills on a podcast I had previously made for another class.</td><td>Since this is about audacity, I started to familiarize myself with the program. I watched the available Lynda tutorials, in addition to one about podcasting. To practice the skills, I used an old podcast I had made about Westerns and the impact on Native Americans. Even my older podcasts were about social and pop culture issues, so I think the documentary idea will be effective. This practice was helpful for me to feel more comfortable using the program so when I start recording next week I'll be prepared.</td></tr>
              <tr><td>7pm/Feb.26</td><td>8:30pm/Feb.26</td><td>Writing the script for my podcast.</td><td>I spent a few hours fleshing out the script outline for my actual podcast. I decided to just make a bulleted list of key points. I wrote out an introduction that I plan to follow but the main body will be improvised. My topic will focus on analyzing white privilege using three documentaries I have recently watched. I tried to capture a witty, yet reflective tone in my overall content. I mostly wrote down facts and main points I want to discuss, but I plan on just talking and editing down later so I have the most content to work with and not limit myself. Also, most of my favorite podcasts are quite lengthy but the chattiness and personality added to each makes it exciting, which is what I tried to accomplish in preparing my script.</td></tr>
              <tr><td>5:30pm/Feb.28</td><td>6:15pm/Feb.28</td><td>Finding music and audio to incorporate into my podcast</td><td>After Tuesday's class I decided to explore some of the free music and audio sources given by the professor. I spent a while listening to and downloading options to incorporate into my intro, transitions, and closing. I focused on finding something modern sounding.</td></tr>
              <tr><td>11am/March 2</td><td>1pm/March 2</td><td>Recording the podcast.</td><td>This morning I recorded my podcast. I really wanted to use a microphone but, unfortunately, time and midterms took over my week. I waited to record in a small quiet space using my phone to get the best possible sound. I have enough content to work with. I'm pleased with how it went, and even though it's not perfect it's authentic and I'm excited to start editing. When I do start to edit I will be referring back to Lynda tutorials to compress and edit the sound to make sure it sounds clear. It was actually quite fun to talk about something I'm interested in because usually for assignments I would write an essay. Podcasts are much more modern and laid back. I think I captured my voice and tone better through a recording than I would have in writing. This was part of my reason for not writing a complete script.</td></tr>
              <tr><td>3pm/March 5</td><td>5:50pm/March 5</td><td>Editing the podcast.</td><td>Since my podcast is so long, it took me quite a while to go through multiple times and edit and cut out audio. Additionally, I had to condense the audio for a better sound quality. Since my podcast isn't meant to be scripted I didnt have to cut out rehearsed scripts and memorized mistakes, which made it a much faster process. Next, I'm going to edit in the audio for transitions and make final touches. I've done most of the tedious work which took me a while to get through.</td></tr>
              <tr><td>12:35pm/March 7</td><td>1:55pm/March 7</td><td>Final podcasts edits, and sound transitions.</td><td>This step didn't take as long as I thought. Fading audio in and out to transition my podcast smoothly was quite straightforward. I added the music I had previously found to add some life and personality. Additionally, I made some small edits to make sure the podcast sounded polished, yet maintained the casual and witty tone of the content and my personal voice. I think it's done!</td></tr>
