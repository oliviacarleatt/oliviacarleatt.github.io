            <tr><th>Start time/date</th><th>End time/date</th><th>Description of focus</th><th>Notes on process</th>
            <tr><td>6pm/Feb.18</td><td>6:45pm/Feb.18</td><td>Researching the best microphones for podcasting.</td><td>I wanted to check out a microphone but I’ve been busy with midterms so this week I focused on research and preparation. I researched the best microphone and found that I could rent it from the library. First, I decided I need a dynamic microphone because they're cheaper and don't pick up as much background noise as a condenser microphone; however, at Pitt the "Podcast Kit" you can rent out only has a condeser microphone. I'm going to go in the beginning of next week to inquire about borrowing a microphone.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>12pm/Feb.19</td><td>2:45pm/Feb.19</td><td>Sampling podcasts that I listen to for inspiration.</td><td>Since I didn’t have much time to practice using audacity I thought I’d focus on the concepts I wanted to incorporate in my own podcast. A chatty or scripted episode? Single speaker or multiple speakers? Serious tone or sarcastic/witty tone? I listened to some of my favorite podcasts, My Favorite Murder, Lore, Mortified, and Who Weekly. I definitely want a witty tone, and since I’m going to be a single speaker I think a script might help me out, but maybe more in the form of talking points so it doesn’t sound robotic and stiff.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>9pm/Feb.19 & 11am/Feb.23</td><td>9:30pm/Feb.19 & 12pm/Feb.23</td><td>Discussing podcast ideas with friends.</td><td>Most of my friends listen to podcasts. I had several conversations with many of my friends to hear what they liked about certain podcasts, and what they thought I should talk about. I know I want to incorporate a feminist aspect because that’s something I’m interested in. My friends like popular culture podcasts overall so I think I’m going to go in that direction. Maybe analyzing a film or show through a feminist perspective. They also told me that they won't listen to poorly recorded podcasts, or podcasts where the tone seemed forced.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>6pm/Feb.21</td><td>6:45pm/Feb.21</td><td>Getting ideas and concepts on paper for possible topics for my podcast.</td><td>I started jotting down concepts for possible scripts. A lot of my ideas have to do with representations of sexuality, gender, and race in popular culture. I also love documentaries so the concept of a podcast talking about and evaluating documentaries is top on my list, and I’m going to work on developing that idea more.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>6pm/Feb.22</td><td>9pm/Feb.22</td><td>Researching possible documentary choices by watching and sampling.</td><td>I put together a list of documentaries I’ve seen and would like to evaluate, and I also went on Kanopy to look at documentaries I might like to watch to evaluate. I watched Anita, Southern Belle, The Uncomfortable Truth, and White Like Me. All examine a social issue such as race, gender, and sexual harassment.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>11am/Feb.23</td><td>1pm/Feb.23</td><td>Watching tutorials to refresh my Audacity knowledge, and learn basics of podcasting with the program. Additionally, I practiced these skills on a podcast I had previously made for another class.</td><td>Since this is about audacity, I started to familiarize myself with the program. I watched the available Lynda tutorials, in addition to one about podcasting. To practice the skills, I used an old podcast I had made about Westerns and the impact on Native Americans. Even my older podcasts were about social and pop culture issues, so I think the documentary idea will be effective. This practice was helpful for me to feel more comfortable using the program so when I start recording next week I'll be prepared.</td></tr>
