    <h2>Skills Assignment: Post 1</h2>
    <p>I’m really into podcasts, so for the skills practice I want to explore how to make a polished podcast. Most of the podcasts I listen to are clean and flow from one segment to the next with ease. I’ve used Audacity in the past, but only the basics, and my projects always came out imperfect. Cleaning up audio clips, as well as learning how to make seamless cuts or trims to audio is something I want to learn. Additionally, podcasts have several music elements, so learning how to pare those and blend them into an audio piece would also be useful. 

The Plan:

1.	Learning how to record audio is the first and most important step. You have to pay attention to the environment around you, microphone quality, and your own tone. For this step, I’m thinking about renting professional recording equipment from Hillman Library. First, I’ll have to research which microphone would be best.
2.	Additionally, whenever I’ve used audacity I’ve just recorded from my phone and uploaded the clips. I plan on using the microphone directly with the program. I found an article online that explains how to get Audacity to recognize your external microphone. 
3.	Recording a sample audio piece to edit and practice with shouldn’t take me very long. Once the microphone is set up I’ll record a 2-minute sample audio that I can use to practice on. This will take trial and error until I find the best formula to get the clearest clip. 
4.	Once I’ve practiced enough with recording I want to dedicate a good amount of time to learning how a podcast is constructed, and how to write one. I’ll listen to podcasts I follow, as well as find others to see what style will work best for me, and help me to pick a topic. 
5.	Next, after I have an outline or script, and have found the best recording method, and microphone, I will dedicate time to recording it as well as finding royalty free music to incorporate for transitions. 
6.	After having the meet of the podcast recorded, I will devote several hours to watching and practicing editing features of audacity. I’ve already found a few videos that will help me cut, trim, and paste audio. 
7.	In-case I decide to use a clip that sounds rough, and needs cleaning up audio I’ll practice and watch tutorials on compression, and removing background noise. 
8.	Next, I want to practice normalizing audio and working with EQ.
9.	Since many podcasts might have more than one speaker, I want to practice incorporating interviews, media clips, or recording with another person. 
10.	My last few hours will be spent going back over my podcast and refining areas that I missed, finding other material to put in empty spaces, and continuing to research other podcasts so I can find elements I want to incorporate and change in my own.
