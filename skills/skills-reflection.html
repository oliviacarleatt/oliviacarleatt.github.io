    <h2>Final Skills Reflection</h2>
    <p>Throughout the past few weeks I’ve strengthened my skills with the program, Audacity, by creating a podcast. I have worked with Audacity before, but never took the time to really delve into the program and create a lengthy, time consuming, project. My podcast is roughly an hour in length. It’s a chatty show about documentaries and how they relate to my personal thoughts on society. For the skills practice I worked on an episode about white privilege and white supremacy by analyzing three documentary films. I’m studying communications and wanted to turn a visual media(documentary) into a verbal and auditory form, focusing on a discussion and conversational based format.</p>

<p>I wanted to do a podcast because they are a trendy piece of media that I enjoy, but reflect an older style of media, radio shows. I grew up listening to “The Big Broadcast,” an old-time radio show that would play classic programs from 7pm-11pm every Sunday night. Today, I listen to podcasts at night, in the shower, and walking to class. They resemble the simplicity of entertainment by focusing on sound, yet are just as captivating as a visual. I wanted to see if I was capable of contributing just one episode to the world of podcasting, and audio recording which I love so much.</p>

<p>Initially, I had planned on renting a condenser microphone and headphones from Hillman but I didn’t manage my time well, especially around midterms, so I had to use my phone, which ended up being fine. It would have had a clearer and more professional sound had a I used the extra equipment. Also, it would have been good experience to set up and use recording equipment, something I’ve never done. I might not have had to go back and condense and edit the sound of my recordings as much if I had used the microphone. This being said, I was able to work on other skills because of the recording quality. I had to use my iPhone to record which has an okay quality. To make it even clearer I followed Lynda tutorials to edit the sound. I actually think this turned out to be a better experience for me because in the future, if I’m pressed for time and I don’t have the extra resources I now know how to get the best recording quality and sound from my phone, something I always have with me.</p> 

<p>Since Audacity is a pretty straightforward program a lot of my time went to working on the actual content of the podcast. I can edit and spend time making sure the quality is good, but if the content is lacking, who cares how it sounds? I spent a lot of time, maybe too much, listening to podcasts I follow and taking notes on elements I liked. I incorporated a chatty style, a lengthy recording, and witty humor because I knew a lengthy episode had to maintain interest. Additionally, a lot of my friends listen to podcasts so I had conversations about what topics and styles they were interested in. They agreed they liked chatty podcasts because they are like conversations with friends. My favorite podcast, My Favorite Murder, consists of a slightly under researched conversation about specific murders that the two hosts pick per episode. The less scripted I think the funnier and more genuine the show, which is what I did, also because I knew it would take less time to plan a script and editing would be easier because I wasn’t focused on memorizing and messing up. It would have been fun to have had a cohost on my skills assignment, so maybe I’d do that differently.</p>

<p>On a previous mini podcast, I worked on for another class, I had inserted sound clips from television and film into my recording to add an extra element. If I had more time I’d definitely add sound clips from the documentaries. I would have been able to do this if I had managed my time better, but I don’t think it takes away from my final product. Also, if I had more time I would have liked to try to make my own music for the transitions. I only worked with some of the tools on Audacity for the podcast, so music would have allowed me to play with different functions and skills.</p>

    <p>I tried looking up additional tutorials besides Lynda, but most things were quite basic and repetitive so I learned it was about the details when editing the audio. Fading in music and transitioning smoothly took a while. I had to zoom in quite closely to the recordings to manipulate the perfect sound manipulations so it sounded fluid. I had practiced with a sample podcast I made a while ago to refresh my memory of the program. It took me quite a while to go through and edit my podcast simply because of the length, so in the future I might try to condense it to maybe 40 minutes. It got quite frustrating to keep trying to find my place in the recording if I wanted to edit specific parts because they’d get lost in the length of the audio. Also, I worked a lot on cutting out pauses and awkward talking points. Again, I zoomed in close to the recording and focused on trying to cut out sections while maintaining the natural flow. Sometimes this was difficult because words would get slightly cut off too soon and I’d have to redo the cut.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m quite proud of my final result. The podcast represented me quite well, and I had fun recording it. I think I achieved the tone and style I was aiming for. I’m going to look and see if there are any good documentary podcasts out there. I think this is a genuinely good episode and it would be fun to try and make another, maybe with a cohost. I found it’s quite easy to do when no one is around. Just pull out your phone in a quiet space and start talking!</p>
