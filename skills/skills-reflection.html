    <h2>Final Skills Reflection</h2>
    <p>Throughout the past few weeks I’ve strengthened my skills with the program, Audacity, by creating a podcast. I have worked with Audacity before, but never took the time to delve into the program and create a lengthy, time consuming, project. My podcast is roughly an hour in length. It’s a chatty show about documentaries and how they relate to my personal thoughts on society. For the skills practice I worked on an episode about white privilege and white supremacy by analyzing three documentary films. I’m studying communications and wanted to turn a visual media(documentary) into a verbal and auditory form, focusing on a discussion and conversational based format.</p>

<p>I wanted to do a podcast because they are a trendy piece of media that I enjoy, but reflect an older style of media, radio shows. I grew up listening to “The Big Broadcast,” an old-time radio program. Today, I listen to podcasts everywhere I go. They resemble the simplicity of entertainment by focusing on sound, yet are just as captivating as a visual. I wanted to see if I was capable of contributing just one episode to the world of podcasting.</p>

<p>Initially, I had planned on renting a condenser microphone and headphones from Hillman but I didn’t manage my time well, especially around midterms, so I had to use my phone, which ended up being fine. It would have had a clearer and more professional sound had a I used the extra equipment. Also, it would have been good experience to set up and use recording equipment, something I’ve never done. I might not have had to go back and condense and edit the sound of my recordings as much if I had used the microphone. This being said, I was able to work on other skills because of the recording quality like editing out background noise. I had to use my iPhone to record which has an okay quality, and recording in a quiet space obviously helps. I actually think this turned out to be a better experience for me because in the future, if I’m pressed for time and I don’t have the extra resources I now know how to get the best recording quality and sound from my phone, something I always have with me. </p> 

<p>Since Audacity is a pretty straightforward program a lot of my time went to working on the actual content of the podcast. I can edit and spend time making sure the quality is good, but if the content is lacking, who cares how it sounds? I spent a lot of time, maybe too much, listening to podcasts, taking notes on elements I liked. I incorporated a chatty style, a lengthy recording, and witty humor because I knew a lengthy episode had to maintain interest. Additionally, a lot of my friends listen to podcasts so I had conversations about what topics and styles they were interested in. They agreed they liked chatty podcasts because they are like conversations with friends. The less scripted would take less time to plan a script and recording would be easier because I wasn’t focused on memorizing.</p>

<p>On a previous mini podcast, I worked on for another class, I inserted sound clips from film into my recording to add an extra element. If I had more time I’d definitely add sound clips from the documentaries, finding how to download them and edit them. I would have been able to do this if I had managed my time better. Also, if I had more time I would have liked to try to make my own music for the transitions. I only worked with some of the tools on Audacity for the podcast, so music would have allowed me to play with different functions and skills, and expand my versatility with Audacity.</p>

    <p>I tried looking up additional tutorials besides Lynda, though the Learning Audacity lesson by Garrick Chow was a good refresher—Content Marketing: Podcasts and Audio by C.C. Chapman was also helpful— but most things were quite basic and repetitive so I learned it was about the details when editing the audio such as compressing and properly, but a lot of my time was spent cutting down content. Fading in music and transitioning smoothly took a while. I had to zoom in quite closely to the recordings to manipulate the perfect sound manipulations so it sounded fluid. I had practiced with my sample podcast the week prior, so a lot of my experimental practice of effects and audio clean up happened there, making those tasks on my actual podcast easier. It took me quite a while to go through and edit because of the length. In the future, I might try to shorten it. It was frustrating to keep trying to find my place in the recording if I wanted to edit specific parts because they’d get lost in the length of the audio. Also, I worked a lot on cutting out pauses and awkward talking points. Again, I zoomed in close to the recording and focused on trying to cut out sections while maintaining the natural flow. Sometimes this was difficult because words would get slightly cut off too soon and I’d have to redo the cut. I decided to all of my editing in one go from my bed (it made work seem less stressful) because if I had taken a day or two off I might really forget where certain cuts were meant to go and honestly might not have been motivated to sit and listen to my voice any longer.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m quite proud of my final result. The podcast represented me quite well, and I had fun recording it. Editing was frustrating but I by practicing with an old podcast, guided by tutorials I at least knew how to operate the program which helped the editing move smoother. I definitely want to work on improving sound quality and structure in the future, and even experiment with music functions of Audacity.</p>
