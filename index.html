    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Olivia Goldstein. I am a third-year student at the University of Pittsburgh, pursuing a degree in Communications, a minor in Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies, and a certificate in Public and Professional Writing. I am passionate about intersectional feminism and representation in the media, which tie my fields of study together. While growing up, being close to major cities such as Baltimore and D.C. definitely helped shape my avid interest in music. Going to concerts has always been important to my life. In addition to music, I listen to podcasts, my favorite at the moment is, My Favorite Murder. I’m constantly listening, watching, and consuming digital media. Whether I’m walking to and from class or trying to fall asleep, something is taking up space in my head when my brain needs a break from thinking.</p>
