    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! Welcome to the portfolio of Olivia Goldstein. Olivia is a third year Pitt student studying communications, gender, gexuality, and women’s studies, and public and professional writing. Try saying all of that at beginning of the semester ice-breakers. You can find Olivia wearing a red beret, and buying yellow flowers with her pierced nose—and septum—buried in a poetry book. While her simple way of life charms passers-by, she is probably listening to her favorite podcast, My Favorite Murder, or a cynical song by a punk band. From intersectional feminism to representation in the very media she consumes, Olivia never stops thinking about how her favorite things contribute to a much bigger picture. This can bring anxiety or excitement, but either way her assignments must be completed. So enjoy this webiste, because she took the time to create this for you!
