    <h2>In-Class Writing Assignment: Envisioning Your Design</h2>
    <p>Harsh, saturated, and loud are characteristics some websites might benefit from. A bouncy castle rental website might show off their fun kid-oriented business, or a sports team fan page might embrace vibrant colors to represent team spirit. Personally, refined and minimalistic websites catch my eye the most. I like a clean white or pastel background with hints of color and small accents that show the authors personality while also engaging the audience and showcasing the content. While not all websites should or must be simple, I will base mine on a crisp yet whimsical aesthetic.</p>
<p>For this course, the website will serve as a portfolio to house my work. Keeping a minimal, almost soft design theme will help to bring out my assignments—the purpose of the website—butsmall thoughtful details like accent colors and coordinating fonts will showcase the design on the website. As for colors, I want to stick to pastel or muted tones, yellow I know will be a key player as it’s my favorite color so it should be on mywebsite. I closely follow a food blog called My Cozy Kitchen. The dishes are rustic but have a modern twist, which I think is reflected in the website. I want my website to have clean lines to show modernity as well, but find a more whimsical font for headers to show softnessto counterbalance the professional aspect of the content. I also think incorporating a graphic element such as an image of myself to go with the “About Me” section. If a website is not easy to navigate then the appearance doesn’t matteras much. My website will have a clearly labeled and spaced out navigationmenu at the top.I want to work in a drop-down option when you hover over each menu item, so it will link you to the specific page you’re looking for because the audience will want to access assignments quickly and efficiently.</p>
