    <p>FOUND: Toxic Masculinity</p> 

<p>I’ve been finding toxic masculinity left around everywhere recently. My friend found some on her tinder date after she refused to go home with a young man. He then texted her she was “fat” and “ugly” and didn’t want her anyway. I guess the pestering at the bar to go to his place was a joke! I also found some on an Instagram comment from a helpful guy I went to high school with. Apparently, guys like girls who are natural. My winged eyeliner and red lipstick just wasn’t his type, thank god! Won’t make that mistake again. Speaking of social media, I also saw a post where a grown man, made fun of a young boy for doing makeup—very well I might add. Anyways, I’m tired of holding onto your toxic masculinity for you. If you don’t come forward and claim it I’ll be forced to throw it in the trash, definitely shouldn’t be recycled. </p>
