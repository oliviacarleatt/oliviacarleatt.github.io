    <h2>Work In Progress 1</h2>
    <p>Web design and coding are foreign concepts to me. Before beginning my website, I had absolutely no experience using html and CSS. Much of my approach has been trial and error, as shown by my over 100 commitments on Github. The Lynda tutorials have been a massive help, as well as googling how to do certain CSS stylistic applications. Though my website isn’t much different from the original instructions given in class for a basic website, I have attempted to make it my own in subtle ways. The first thing I did was change the font. I spent a while browsing GoogleFonts and settled on Megrim for my main heading and Raleway for the body. The main heading font is a bit whimsical and modern. The clean lines maintain the minimalistic feel but the triangular accents add an artistic approach to highlight my name. I feel like it acts a logo because of the shapes in the font.</p> 

<p>Spacing was also important to me. When I think of minimalism I also think of white space so I added spacing between my lines of text so it was easier on the eye to read. Having spaced out text creates a sense of openness and ease, especially for a home page. It’s not as harsh or intimidating. My main project was transforming the navigation menu. It was harsh and I didn’t like the link changing color after it had been visited. I wanted to keep the menu simple but I added a pop of a hover color to keep it playful and whimsical. Though red and yellow don’t scream light and soft, I used “crimson” and “gold”. These colors were less harsh than standard “yellow” and “red” and I think are done is subtle ways.</p>

<p>I took the time to completely redo my “About Me” written portion of the assignment. My first draft was bland and didn’t have the tone I wanted. When rewriting, I wanted to focus on a more lighthearted approach to myself. My website is minimal so I wanted my writing to stand out and show my personality. I tried to keep to a witty tone this time and I changed to third person. I thought adding a mix of academic and personal details would maintain the purpose of the website—to act as a portfolio—but also to represent myself and paint a picture of how I might put my own personal spin on assignments. The one thing I wish I had figured out how to do was add a photo. I think adding a circular photo next to my bio would add another personal touch, and the softness of the edges will keep the website flowing. Flow was also a factor when choosing my header font. The open lines show movement.</p>

<p>The area I had the most difficulty with was getting my relative links to work. I would be lying if I said I didn’t cry at least once whilst working on this assignment. I tried several different possible solutions both guessing and suggestions from the internet. After emailing the professor, and being informed my link were written correctly, I then looked to make sure the folders in the repository were set up correctly. After reading the Webucator instructions I finally figured out my error. I realized I hadn’t put .html at the end of each work-1/sample- and /sample-2. I think I want to create a drop-down menu with them eventually. Additionally, I think overall when steps were laid out for me and taught in the classroom I comprehended the coding. The Lynda videos were helpful, but for some of the things I wanted to design I was limited because I couldn’t find a match of what I wanted, a problem I ran into with the sample links. Next time I might go to office hours, or dedicate more time for practicing the exercises through the Lynda tutorials so I get more familiar and comfortable with CSS.</p>

<p>As far as goals go, I’m interested in strengthening and improving my Audacity skills. I’ve worked with the programs in other classes to create podcasts and audio essays. I created a podcast for a philosophy of race course about the racism and oppression towards Native Americans created by the “Western” film genre. I was proud of it but I wish I could have made it more polished and professional sounding. Learning how to manipulate sound and fade and cut audio just perfectly would be a good skill to have. I also already have an interest in podcasts in general and would like to be able to explore that genre further, and learn the skills needed to create a successful podcast. I would also like to further hone my CSS/HTML skills. Aesthetics of my website are very important to me. So far, I’ve even struggled to do basic coding so being able to understand the language of coding better would help my overall website flow. I want to learn how to add an audio feature to my website, so maybe that coding aspect will tie into my interest in audacity as well. Additionally, I have never worked with Photoshop. I had a friend learn how to repurpose old photographs and create mash-up collages. Even though my website is on the minimalistic side, I’d like to use Photoshop to alter images for the website. Maybe I’ll learn how to give them an illustrative quality to play to the whimsical feel I want to achieve. I also think making a logo or silhouette to put alongside my header would be a good contribution to my website. </p>
