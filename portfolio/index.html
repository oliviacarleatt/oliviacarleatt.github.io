    <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
    <p>This class has been one of the most emotionally and mentally intense. I really pushed myself and overcame many obstacles. Coming into the semester I had no experience with Photoshop or HTML/CSS. Those were the main things I focused on for revision. I spent many hours in the Cathedral computer lab slaving away on Photoshop. Though I’m still not a master of any of the programs I used this semester, I definitely feel more competent using them, and hopefully this will come in handy in the future. I want to start by addressing my biggest accomplishment, my website. I didn’t think I’d ever get to the point of being happy with my coding. I also expected to have a mediocre website that worked but that I really wasn’t proud of. When I would visit home over the semester I felt like I was back in elementary school because I’d show my parents the progress on my website. My concept of website building was WordPress and SquareSpace. I didn’t believe I could take my aesthetic vision and execute it. To revise my website, I’d make sure I was in a comfortable environment like my bed or couch and treat it like practice and it was obviously low stakes. I spent several hours just figuring out basic functions, but I eventually started understanding the language of coding which helped move me along quickly. In terms of audience, I was going for professional, but with a twist. My bio shows my personality, but also shows my educational background. The aesthetic is clean and simple, which shows that I care about appearance and first impressions. I also think my small touches like photo and color usage make my website memorable, and most all, represents who I am which is important when my work is being viewed, evaluated, and judged.</p>

<p>Editing was a big part of this course. Most classes have one rough draft, one peer review, and then you turn in your final. I felt myself constantly revisiting projects, which made it easier for me to actually produce edits I really liked, instead of just for the sake of editing. For instance, my movie poster had many different forms. It first started out as my groups mashup of musical and horror films. I thought I wanted to take a similar approach with a different poster as the base. Then my vision completely changed, and I decided to go in the indie direction and produced something extremely different. To me, editing is all about trial and error, just ask my 400+ commits on GitHub. Arola says, “Although each mode plays a role in the overall message, it is the combination of modes—the multimodality—that create is the full piece of communication” (4). I focused on all of the modes except gestural. Spatial mode was my biggest concern throughout most of the projects, especially the website. I also really wanted to concentrate on getting the spatial qualities right because the way they’re viewed depends on an accessible and easily navigable website, “…so that readers can find their way through the text without difficulty” (Arola 10). The online format presents its own set of expectations for the audience as well, aside from the individual classwork. In terms of affordances, I definitely noticed this with the sound projects, especially since I’ve been taking ASL, I’ve been more aware of different texts and their accessibility. The soundscape could have a detailed, and creative text to accompany it for those who are Deaf. This would have also given me another opportunity to practice my creative writing skills. For my bio I definitely took advantage of this, as well as early assignments like the Craigslist Ad. Visually, the movie poster has to grasp the genres al in one, but there is so much more to movies, especially Wes Anderson films. Music and symmetry make his films, so this is definitely an affordance when it comes to the visual movie poster.</p>

<p>In terms, of audience, this influences my writing. Since this website is really for a class first and foremost, the professor has been my target audience, at least for much of the writing; however, “while it is not necessarily your job to consider how the text will function if read by those outside the intended audience, doing so can sometimes be illuminating” (Arola 23). Audience wasn’t my first priority, but I did keep it in the back of my mind. The movie poster was particular to Wes Anderson fans, especially in relation to fan renditions of posters. Someone outside of that wouldn’t understand right away, or why it’s so minimal. As far as my logo for Polaroid, audience is definitely important here. That was the project I definitely focused on for audience. I wanted to turn the vintage logo into a more modern take. Since this would mean rebranding, I focused on a younger audience. Instagram actually does the reverse of this and their icon for the app is a vintage camera. I think the logo works and stands out amongst single-color logos of other major companies today, like Facebook. Overall, my writing throughout my website is reflective of who I am, but I definitely took a little while to get there. Since my bio is the first thing someone would see on my website, I needed to make sure it reflected my individual style and personality. The first draft of my bio was boring, awkward, and flat. I took a step back and completely started over, which is what I tend to do when reproaching something to edit. I made sure to make it memorable and true to myself, even if that meant veering from a serious tone. Overall, I’m happy with my bio because I think it reflects the way my website looks, but through words. Even if a potential employer was looking at this website, I feel confident that I remain formal, but hold onto my character.</p>

<p>I can honestly say I want to continue updating this website and using it for future projects. I might want to turn it into a travel blog while I study abroad in London this summer, or even just use it to house my own personal writing, resume, and work I’m proud of. I really don’t want to abandon it after I’ve worked so hard to get it to where it is today. I will never be a master at coding or photoshop, as I lack the motivation and skills, but I definitely know I feel a lot more well-rounded after taking this course and dipping my toe into the various forms and programs for digital media. Though I cried and struggled, I know that this final portfolio has shown my abilities. I never want to work on a story board again, but I know I’m better for at least trying to attempt one. I can’t wait to see how this website evolves as I embark on my final year in college.</p>
