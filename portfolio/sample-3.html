    <p>I chose to compare my two sound scapes from WIP 2. The original was messy and needed cleaning up. Compared to the revised version, the original is confusing. Sounds overlap in strange places and it doesn’t make sense. The revised sound scape is much more cohesive and flows effortlessly through the drunken narrative. My original plan for the sound scape was to have someone drinking a beer and incorporating burbs, gulps, and bottle caps, mixed with the sound of what it’s like underwater to mimic someone floating in the bottle. The revised version also does a better job implementing the progressive stream of the subject getting drunk demonstrated by the tempo slowing down. This example shows my attention to detail and my ability to edit and follow a narrative. If I were to revise again, I might make the second version longer so there could be more buildup, and when the bottle smashes at the end I could continue the journey of the person inside the bottle. They could stumble around the feet of the people at the party, and the overall story of the piece would be significantly elevated.</p>
