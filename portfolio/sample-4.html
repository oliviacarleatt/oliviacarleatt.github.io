    <p>My biggest fail this semester has been the storyboard. I desperately wanted to complete it, but ran into poor timing issues, and I really wanted to work with photoshop for other assignment, so it got put on the back burner. I have hardly a few frames thought out, and it’s disappointing to give up on something. For someone who loves documentaries you’d think I would have loved creating a storyboard for a documentary, but that’s the furthest thing from the truth. This project actually taught me to let things go. While this isn’t a skill to apply to every assignment, it ended up stressing me out to the point where it was unhealthy. I usually never quit because I have bad anxiety and issues with guilt—as my therapist knows—so letting go of this project ironically was really beneficial for me. Of course, I failed, but I worked hard on so many other areas, I’ve accepted that I have to settle for mediocrity or even failure. RIP to the storyboard.</p>
