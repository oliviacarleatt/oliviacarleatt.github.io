    <p>Originally, my group decided to mix the 2017 film, It, with the classic musical, Singing in the Rain. I loved this idea, but I decided to mix the horror element of It with the indie genre, particularly as a Wes Anderson film. Instead of lightening the It poster, I started over and took inspiration from the pastel colors Wes Anderson is known for, as well as the style of many fan made posters. These posters are minimal and simple. Since Wes Anderson is not as widely known to the mainstream—that sounds pretentious—than a horror film like It, so maybe choosing a different image than the balloon, like the characters. Doing simple cutouts of the yellow raincoat and cast, incorporating more elements from It would heighten the quirkiness of indie, but show more detail for those interested in It. This would satisfy a stranger and expert to both genres. Additionally, I would want to incorporate reviews and awards on the front.</p>
