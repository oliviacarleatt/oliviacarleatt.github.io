    <p> For my logo I chose Polaroid. For color, Polaroid uses a rainbow of colors, so I took a rainbow gradient, framing the word polaroid to mimic a camera lens. Additionally, I made the dot on the “I” red to emulate the button on the front of a Polaroid camera. If I were to change this, I would scale the letters to overlap the circles. Additionally, I might make the rainbow gradient a bit lighter or more pastel. I like the font, but I might choose something a bit more sleek, thin, and modern to give Polaroid the extra lift and stand out among other modern logos. I could also make the circle into a rounded square which would mimic the shape of the camera, and also be app friendly. It looks a bit harsh to me, and the old Polaroid was simple and vintage looking. I did have a second logo, but it was too distracting and busy. Overall, I’m pleased with how this turned out, but I think I’d change color and font scale to be a bit lighter and minimal.</p>
